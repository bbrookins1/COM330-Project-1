    <h1>Welcome to Barry's Webpage!</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Barry Brookins and I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student. I was born and raised in Chicago, and attended Whitney M. Young Magnet High School. I engage in a wide variety of sports, most notably track & field (participating for Illinois Tech), football, and basketball. I have only been interested in programming since my senior year of high school but have coded many projects in Python since then, some scripts including:
            <ul>
        <li>Web Scraping & Automation</li>
        <li>Algorithms</li>
        <li>Image To Text</li>
        <li>Multithreading</li>
        <li>Path Prediction</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      With this class I plan on learning more than enough about web design in order to create a professional portfolio website detailing my internships, engineering projects, and other experience as well as create another website for my business, with more graphically interesting designs.

    For a few years now I have been interested in autonomous vehicles and everything about them so in the future, after I graduate, I plan on working with autonomous vehicles. I haven't found many websites detailing all that goes into professions of the sort even though I feel like many people would be interested in them, so if that does work out I plan on having a website detailing the profession to those interested.
